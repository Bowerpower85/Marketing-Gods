Refactoring of the code base for Horiseon Media to meet accesibility standards and clear redundencies.
This was a real attempt to gain some experience refatoring code and expose my brain to new tools and concepts.
HTML5 and CSS were used to refactor the code, as I gain experience with JavaScript and databases I will lok to leverage those on the website as well.
